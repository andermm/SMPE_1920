This repository is for the 
*Scientific Methodology and Performance Evaluation for Experimental
Computer* class, in which are located the
files and scripts used to perform the proposed final work
activity. Above are described the files and folders. In addition, to
accurately reproduce this evaluation some softwares are required,
which are listed in the topic *Analysis Environment* at the end of this
file. Further details about the experiments are described in [[./LabBook.org]].

- BATCH
Here are contained the execution and system information collection scripts.
- LOGS
This folder has the logs of the benchmarks execution in a CSV file,
both machine files used by the MPI execution line and the environment
information about the nodes used in the experiments in an ORG file.
- LOGS/BACKUP
In this folder are contained the backup logs about each application
and interconnection.
- NPB3.4
This folder has the *Nas Parallel Benchmarks (NPB)* in which are
the MPI executables are compiled.
- R
This folder has the *Design of Experiments (DoE)* script in an R file,
which was used to create the experimental project in a CSV file, used
to execute the binaries of the NPB randomly.
- LabBook.org
In this file are described the objective of this work, as well as, the
step-by-step of the entire project.

* Analysis Environment 
As mentioned before, some specific softwares are necessary to
reproduce this evaluation accurately. They are:
- Emacs and Org capable of compiling blocks of R code using Org-Babel
They are used as a project management tool to keep track, record
all the information, and  generate the graphics using blocks of
R code. A complete tutorial about how to install and configure the
mentioned software are available [[https://app-learninglab.inria.fr/gitlab/learning-lab/mooc-rr-ressources/blob/master/module2/ressources/emacs_orgmode.org][here]]. If you don't want to use this
softwares, you can copy the blocks of code and use R or RStudio to
generate the graphics.
